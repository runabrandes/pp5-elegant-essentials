## PROJECT IDEA

My idea for this project stems from my PP4, which I developed a spa website for. I wanted to create a B2C e-commerce project based on a similar idea and have decided on an online beauty shop. 
The website offers a selection of products and features, such as buying beauty products, leaving reviews for the shop, signing up to a newsletter service, contacting the shop via a conatct form and more.

When planning the project the most important features to me were:

1. Welcoming homepage
2. Good selection of products
3. User-friendly interface
4. Product descriptions and intersting product images
5. Simple design to allow users to navigate the website easily
6. Search functionality to help users find products easily
7. Contact form for customers
8. Search bar to allow customers to find certain products quickly

## UX / UI

### User Stories

To plan the User Stories for this project I have created a Kanban board in Github which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/users/runabrandes/projects/4).

I have used Agile Methodology throughout the project and moved the different items on the Kanban board according to what I was working on at the time. I have also added a row for Future Implementations, which holds 3 items that are not yet implemented but would be nice features the website could have in the future.
MoSCoW was also used for this project to help prioritise features.
