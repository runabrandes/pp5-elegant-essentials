## PROJECT IDEA

My idea for this project stems from my PP4, which I developed a spa website for. I wanted to create a B2C e-commerce project based on a similar idea and have decided on an online beauty shop. 
The website offers a selection of products and features, such as buying beauty products, leaving reviews for the shop, signing up to a newsletter service, contacting the shop via a conatct form and more.

When planning the project the most important features to me were:

1. Welcoming homepage
2. Good selection of products
3. User-friendly interface
4. Product descriptions and intersting product images
5. Simple design to allow users to navigate the website easily
6. Search functionality to help users find products easily
7. Contact form for customers
8. Search bar to allow customers to find certain products quickly

## UX / UI

## OVERVIEW

- The website was created using Django and features CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality and a user-friendly UI to make buying products from the website sraightforward.
The overall navigation is easy to use and simple to understand so users can find anything they are looking for quickly.
- The user can sign up to the website and when logged in, they can buy products from the shop, leave reviews, as well as edit and delete these.
All other functionalities (e.g. contacting the store and reading reviews from authorised users) are accessible by all site users not matter if they have an account or not.
- Logged-in users can see their past orders and default profile (shipping) information.
The overview of past orders placed has a clickable order number that opens a past order confirmation page, so the user can see where the particular order was shipped to and what phone number was given for the order when it was placed.
- Admin users have extra functionality in the admin panel, being able to search orders by date and username. They can also approve reviews that users have written, so they become visible on the website for everyone to read. Admins can delete orders and user profiles, add questions and answers to the FAQ page and add more products to the website store or delete products if required.
Furthermore, they can view contact requests that might have been sent to the store.

### User Stories

To plan the User Stories for this project I have created a Kanban board in Github which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/users/runabrandes/projects/4).

I have used Agile Methodology throughout the project and moved the different items on the Kanban board according to what I was working on at the time. I have also added a row for Future Implementations, which holds 3 items that are not yet implemented but would be nice features the website could have in the future.
MoSCoW was also used for this project to help prioritise features.
