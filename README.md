## PROJECT IDEA

My idea for this project stems from my PP$, which I developed a spa website for. I wanted to create an e-commerce project based on a similar idea and have decided on an online beauty shop. 
The website offers a selection of products and features, such as buying beauty products, leaving reviews for the shop, signing up to a newsletter service, contacting the shop via a conatct form and more.

When planning the project the most important features to me were:

1. Welcoming homepage
2. Good selection of products
3. User-friendly interface
4. Product descriptions and intersting product images
5. Simple design to allow users to navigate the website easily
6. Search functionality to help users find products easily
7. Contact form for customers
